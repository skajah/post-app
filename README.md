[SBKonnect](https://sbk-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

A simple web app that allows users to post content (text and/or media), comment on posts, search for posts by different criteria, and follow other users.


**Note:** This repository has been broken up into 2 separate repositories in order to make deployment more convenient. To get the most up to date code, use [sbk-frontend](https://github.com/skajah/sbk-frontend) and [sbk-backend](https://github.com/skajah/sbk-backend) repositories. Instructions on running a local version are provided in each repo.

This is my first Full Stack Project after learning the MERN Stack for a few months. Gotta start somewhere :P
